# 🏥 Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)

This project aims to build an AI-powered Clinical Decision Support System that assists doctors in predicting patient diagnoses based on vital signs, symptoms, demographic details, and lab test results. By leveraging machine learning, the system enhances diagnostic accuracy, reduces time pressure on clinicians, and promotes data-driven healthcare.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Doctors often face difficulty making accurate and timely diagnoses due to the overwhelming complexity and volume of patient data (e.g., symptoms, vitals, lab results). Under pressure, this can lead to diagnostic errors or delays, affecting patient outcomes and increasing healthcare costs. There is a need for a system that can analyze data quickly and assist in decision-making.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We developed a Clinical Decision Support System using historical patient data and machine learning models. The system processes inputs like:
- Patient demographics (age, gender)
- Symptoms
- Vital signs (BP, temperature, oxygen levels)
- Lab test results

The system uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict likely diagnoses. Predictions are displayed via a user-friendly interface, helping clinicians make faster, evidence-based decisions.
